## Activities

Activities roll up to milestones. Keep at the size one specialist can
own end-to-end.

| ID | Activity | Owner (teammate) | Predecessors | Duration | Start | Finish | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A-M0-1 | M0 baseline scaffold + PM artifact opens (this turn — T005/T006/T007/T008) | `project-manager` | — | 1 turn | 2026-05-13 | 2026-05-13 | in-progress |
| A-M1-1 | M1.1 compact runtime contracts (PR-2a) | `architect` + `software-engineer` | M0 gate G0 | TBD | 2026-05-13 | 2026-05-13 | passed |
| A-M1-2 | M1.2 archive-registers.sh (PR-2) | `software-engineer` | M0 gate G0 | TBD | 2026-05-13 | 2026-05-13 | passed |
| A-M1-3 | Token ledger automation (PR-3) | `software-engineer` | A-M0-1 | TBD | 2026-05-13 | 2026-05-13 | passed |
| A-M1-4 | PM live-surface split (PR-4) | `project-manager` | A-M1-2 | TBD | 2026-05-13 | 2026-05-13 | passed |

## Critical path

List the activities on the critical path (longest dependency chain).
Any slip here moves the milestone.

- A-M0-1 → A-M1-1 → A-M1-3 → A-M1-4 (M1.1 compact contracts must land
  before token ledger can measure post-compact deltas; PM split
  consumes the archive script from A-M1-2 in parallel).

## Baseline snapshot

Record the baseline date and the milestone dates at baseline. Do not
edit once baselined — re-baseline with a change log row.

| Baseline | Date set | Milestones at baseline |
|---|---|---|
| B-0 | 2026-05-13 | M0: 2026-05-13; M1: TBD (set at G0 gate close). |
